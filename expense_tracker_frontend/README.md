# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### CI-friendly quick start

Some CI systems terminate long-running foreground processes (which can appear as exit code 137/kill -9). Use:

- `npm run start:ci` to boot the dev server briefly and exit successfully. This avoids the CI killing the process and incorrectly marking the build as failed.
- Environment variables respected:
  - REACT_APP_PORT: overrides port (defaults to 3000)
  - HOST (defaults to 0.0.0.0)
  - BROWSER=none is set to suppress auto-open

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in non-watch CI mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Environment Variables

The app recognizes these environment variables (configure via your CI/CD or a local `.env`):
- REACT_APP_API_BASE
- REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
- REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL
- REACT_APP_WS_URL
- REACT_APP_NODE_ENV
- REACT_APP_NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED
- REACT_APP_ENABLE_SOURCE_MAPS
- REACT_APP_PORT
- REACT_APP_TRUST_PROXY
- REACT_APP_LOG_LEVEL
- REACT_APP_HEALTHCHECK_PATH
- REACT_APP_FEATURE_FLAGS
- REACT_APP_EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
